# nuke_anything_reloaded
Chrome extension that allows you to hide almost anything via context menu.

Inspired by "Nuke anything (Enhanced)" addon for Firefox. Sadly I could not find anything like it for Chrome (or newer FF version).

Maybe I can find a way to add the visual to see the object to be removed that the FF version has. but for now it just works :)

## Usage

**Right Click:**
- Right-click on any element and select "Remove this object" to hide it.
- Right-click anywhere and select "Undo last remove" to restore the last hidden element.

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- **Alt+Shift+X**: Hide the element under the mouse cursor.
- **Alt+Shift+Z**: Restore the last hidden element.

*Tip: Hold `Alt+Shift` to see a red outline around the element you are about to remove.*
