# ZapIt
Chrome extension that allows you to zap almost anything via context menu.

Inspired by "Nuke anything (Enhanced)" addon for Firefox. Back then, many years ago, when I switched to a chrome based browser, I missed this addon so I decided to create my own version.
Now when I got back to this code "Nuke anything" is available for chrome and it's probably better than my clone. So I decided it is time to think of a new name for my extension. Just keeping the old icons for now.

## Usage

**Right Click:**
- Right-click on any element and select "**Zap this object**" to hide it.
- Right-click anywhere and select "**Undo last zap**" to restore the last hidden element.

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- **Alt+Shift+X**: Zap the element under the mouse cursor.
- **Alt+Shift+Z**: Restore the last hidden element.

*Tip: Hold `Alt+Shift` to see a red outline around the element you are about to zap.*

**Manage Hidden Elements:**
- Click the extension icon in the toolbar to open the list of hidden elements on the current page.
- Click "Unhide" next to an item to restore it.
- Click "Unhide All" to restore everything on the page.
